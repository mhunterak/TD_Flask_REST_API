# Treehouse Python Techdegree Project 10: Todo List API with Flask 
# I AM AIMING FOR THE 'EXCEEDS EXPECTATIIONS' GRADE ON THIS PROJECT!

DESCRIPTION: Take a messy, buggy, badly tested Python code base and improve it. Start with a Django app and identify where it's broken and inefficient. Write and run tests, check for proper validation, analyze views and analyze database calls to improve the site.


# Steps to get the project running:

0. Initialize a new virtual environment of your choosing. I use:
   > `python -m venv .env` 
   and 
   > `source .env/bin/activate`

A predefined build task has been made for users of Visual Studio code in `.vscode/tasks.json`

Or:

1. Use the 
    > `pip install -r requirements.txt` command to install the project dependencies.

2. Run the server.
   > `python app.py`

3. Test the app.
   > `coverage run tests.py && coverage html`
